DevCom website project from the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp - Developent description by Matheus R.

- The original idea was make the already made website responsible, but i decided to make it in my way. I recreated the website desing using the Figma (An ui design software/tool), if you wanna see the design, it's in the "figma_design.txt" file, copy the link in the url. After that, i made the project using the VS Code, using Html5 and Css3.
- Maybe in really big screens the website could be a little small, but i'm sure it's going to be good in the biggest part of the sizes.
- The projects section has generic imagens because i don't want to to use photos of other website and get processed ðŸ˜ƒ.
- If there's either a vocabulary or a gramatic mistake (maybe both), i'm sorry, english isn't my first language, but i'll kepp studing !.

Hope you guys have enjoyed my little work, peace ðŸ¤˜.
