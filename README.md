DevCom website project from the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp - Developent description by Matheus R.

- The original idea was make the already made website responsible using media querys, but i decided to make it in my way. I recreated the website desing using the Figma (An ui design software/tool), if you wanna see the design, it's in the "figma_design.txt" file, copy the link, and past in the url. After that, i developed the project using the VS Code, just with the Html 5 and Css 3 languages.
- Maybe on really big screens the website could be a little small, but i'm sure it's going to be good in the biggest part of the sizes.
- The projects section has generic imagens because i don't want to use photos of other websites and get processed ðŸ˜ƒ.
- If there is a vocabulary or a grammatical error (maybe both), sorry, English is not my first language, but I will keep studying!

Hope you guys have enjoyed my little work, peace ðŸ¤˜.
